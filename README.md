# Crime Rate Prediction Using Machine Learning  

This project leverages machine learning to analyze crime data and predict crime rates based on various socio-economic and demographic factors. The model helps in identifying high-risk areas, enabling better law enforcement and urban planning.  

## Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares crime datasets for analysis.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes crime trends and correlations.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements regression and classification algorithms for crime rate prediction.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Compares performance using metrics like RMSE, accuracy, and precision.  
- **Google Colab Integration**: Run the entire project easily on Colab.  

## How to Use  
1. Open the [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JlIZv9Y0cUO0rmdWZmdQ9RpbOMP3QC0v).  
2. Upload the crime dataset or use the pre-loaded dataset.  
3. Run the preprocessing and model training steps.  
4. Evaluate the model's performance using the provided metrics.  
5. Use the trained model to predict crime rates for new data.  

## Dependencies  
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy
